# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is designing, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages
Development of structured programming languages
Development of agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements - gathering all the user needs and system requirements and documenting them.
Design - process of designing software architecture and user interface
Impementation - writing code for building the system
Testing - Conducting tests to make sure system meets standards
Deployment - Releasing software to users.
Maintenance - Updating software and providing ongoing support

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology is sequential with distinct phases while agile methodology is incremental. Waterfall methodology can be used in large scale projects with wel defined requirements while agile methodology can be used in product development where continuos deveopment i needed.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer writes code for the system and implements it.
Quality assurance engineer makes sure of the code quality by designing and executing tests
Project manager - Oversees the planning, execution and delivery of projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing codes. Example is Eclipse. Version control systems are used for tracking changes to soure code and co-ordinating teamwork. example is Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
the challenges are changing requirements, tight deadlines and technical debt. To overcome these challenges there should be effective communication, identify which tasks to prioritize and regular reassesment of the goals.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is testing individual components, Integration testing is testing the interactions between different components and Acceptance testing is testing software against user requirement. They are important because they help in identifying and fixing defects early in the deveopment process

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is crafting questions or statements to get best possible responses from AI models. It is important because it provides the user with quality responses from AI models and efficiency.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt - tell me more about cats.
you can improve it by saying - tell me about the history of cats, where they were first bred and their habitat.
Improved prompt is more effective because it is specific, clear and straight to the point.
